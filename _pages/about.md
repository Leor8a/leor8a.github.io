I'm Luis Ochoa, an **iOS Developer/Engineer** who loves computer graphics, I had experience making iOS apps for several companies
such as New Land Apps, Lyncott, etc., but now I went back to college to make my proyects happend, 
National Autonomous University of Mexico - Engineering Faculty@(UNAM-FI) to make the stuff I really want to make 
and start working on my thesis.

I **LOVE** to program. I think that if I finish soon my University, I'll make a specialized consultant company on 
computer graphics or a small graphic design studio. I also love music, cats, books and I have alot of different 
hobbies such as dancing, jogging, swimming, diving, etc.

I'm currently learning how to model in Blender and I just love it. I can stay hours doing that and without complaining.
Another thing is that I'm currently learning Objective C for becoming a Sr iOS developer.

My idea is to become a **Full Stack Developer**, but for that, I have a long road ahead.
